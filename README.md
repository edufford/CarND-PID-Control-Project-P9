# **PID Control Project**

**Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree - Project #9**

2017/10/16

## Overview

This project implements a **PID control** algorithm to control the steering while driving a simulated vehicle around a track using feedback on the measured lateral **Cross-Track Error (CTE)**.

Besides the basic Proportional/Integral/Derivative error terms, the PID controller includes some **additional features** such as an integral windup min/max guard, D term latching, smoothing, and min/max guard to prevent spikes from CTE discontinuities, and rate limiting on final output to smooth out the steering movement.

The PID control gains were **initially tuned manually** for various speeds to explore their effects.  After base gains were chosen at the reference speed (30% throttle), further tuning adjustment was done automatically using a **"twiddle" algorithm (coordinate ascent)** to optimize an error function based on combining accumulated CTE and steering work.

## Project Reflection

For more details about the results of this tuning activity, see the [project reflection document](Reflection.md).

## How to Build and Run Code

This project involves the Udacity Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two scripts (**install-mac.sh** and **install-ubuntu.sh**) that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./pid

If using Xcode to build, run the following commands:

1. mkdir xbuild
2. cd xbuild
3. cmake -G "Xcode" ..
4. Open "PID.xcodeproj" in Xcode and build
5. cd Debug
6. ./pid

## Other Important Dependencies

* cmake >= 3.5
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Communication protocol between uWebSocketIO and Simulator

**INPUT to main.cpp**: values provided by the simulator to the C++ program

* ["cte"] => Measured lateral Cross-Track Error
* ["speed"] => Vehicle's last speed (mph)
* ["steering_angle"] => Vehicle's last steering angle (-1 to +1)

**OUTPUT from main.cpp**: values provided by the C++ program to the simulator

* ["steering_angle"] <= Control value for steering angle (-1 to +1)
* ["throttle"] <= Control value for throttle (0 to 1)
